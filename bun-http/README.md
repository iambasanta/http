# `bun-http` is a simple HTTP server

This is a basic guide to creating a simple HTTP server using bun.

### Running the server

To run the server, open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project folder, and execute the following command:

```bash
bun index.js
```

Once the server is running, you should see the message `Listening to port 8000` and `http://localhost:8000` printed in the console.

### Accessing the server

##### Via `curl`

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000 -v
```

Press enter to execute the `curl` command.

##### Via `web browser`

To test your HTTP server, open your web browser and enter `http://localhost:8000` in the address bar.
